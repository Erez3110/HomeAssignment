# HomeAssignment
This repository contains an assignment that was given as part of an interview for a QA Automation Developer position.

This is a Maven Project, written in Java, and use Selenium and TestNG as the testing tools. 
The project supports Data-Driven-Testing (via xls and xml files) and use Allure for reporting.
For this project I have created  a framework that can be used for multiple platforms, in this case Web and API. 
The test cases are written in seperate classes for each task that was given and should be executed as a whole from the TestNG.xml file (saves the time to change URL and platform type for each class).
